# Abstract
Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with the environment, learning
an optimal policy, through trial and error, for sequential decision problems, in a wide
range of fields such as natural sciences, social sciences and engineering. Deep learning,
or deep neural networks, have flourished in recent years and have become prevalent in
reinforcement learning. The aim of this thesis is to present the basic concepts of reinforcement
learning and to apply deep reinforcement learning algorithms to create agents
capable of finishing levels in the video game Super Mario Bros. Agents can learn various
control policies from raw pixel data using deep reinforcement learning. The paper examines
and compares Q-learning algorithms DQN,DDQN and policy optimization algorithms
( Policy Optimization) PPO, A3C.
